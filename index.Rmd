I am a doctoral candidate studying environmental health sciences. My research is focused on understanding human health consequences of the [exposome](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6476/392). I pursue this interest using methods from epidemiology and laboratory sciences.   

My doctoral research focuses on biochemical changes that accompany human diseases of aging (particularly Alzheimer's disease).
